Creating groups
===============

## Aim

In order to evaluate the different elicitation strategies, the group formation step is required.

With the user set $U = \lbrace u_{1},\ldots,u_{n}\rbrace$ we have $${n \choose 2}$$ possible pairwise combinations.

$${n \choose 2} = \frac{n!}{2\,!(n-2)\,!}$$

We need to create a method to create groups with several attirbutes:

* Range Similarity degree between group members / Randomly
* Group size

--------------Mining of Massive Datasets

 This sort of recommendation system can use the groundwork laid in Chapter 3 on similarity search and Chapter 7
on clustering. However, these technologies by themselves are not sufficient, and there are some new algorithms that have proven effective for
recommendation systems.

* **Clustering**: is the process of examining a collection of “points”, and grouping the points into “clusters” according to some distance measure. The goal is that points in the same cluster have a small distance from one another, while points in different clusters are at a large distance from one another. So, the goal of a clustering algorithm is to minimize intra-cluster distances while maximizing inter-cluster distances.

Similarity used to create groups will also be used get recommendations.
